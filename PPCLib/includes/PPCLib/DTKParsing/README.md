# DTK Parsing

All the code dedicated to parsing DTK. It has a lot of very specific strings and bits. Some are not consistant like symbol types and asm types.
So bits of DTK parsing code is just kept with it's PPC equivalnt. Since it would just be a mess otherwise.
All the instructions are stored with their string versions, so we match the massive arrays.
